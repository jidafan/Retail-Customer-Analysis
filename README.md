### Introduction

The project shown is the customer analysis of shoppers from an online retail transaction data set of two years. The program uses KMeans Clustering to group customers and determine strategies for retaining and engaging customers. The data is from a UCI dataset that can be viewed [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii).

### Code

In the [code](https://github.com/jidafan/HR-Dashboard/blob/main/Data%20Generation.ipynb), the Python library **Faker** was used to generate the information about the employees at the company. The dataset simulates employee information typically found in HR systems, including demographics, job details, salary, performance evaluations, and attrition data. The [data](https://github.com/jidafan/HR-Dashboard/blob/main/HumanResources.csv) is then exported to a CSV to be analyzed and visualized in Tableau.
